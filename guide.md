## Initial Setup

Before customizing Scratchbox, ensure that you have set your username. If your username is not set, your selected theme will **always** default to "Bokeh." Here's how to set your username:

1. Navigate to `[Settings] > [Change Username]`.
2. Enter your desired username. This username will also display when playing games on Scratchbox.

## Playing Games

### Featured Games
Scratchbox offers three featured games to get you started. You can find these in the `[Games]` menu.

### Loading Games from the Store
If you'd like to explore more games:
1. Click on the store icon.
2. Browse the store and find a game you want to play.
3. Copy the download code for the game.
4. Go to `[Games] > [Load Another Game]`, paste in the download code, and your game will load.

> Note: You will need an internet connection to use this feature.

### Offline Games
To download games for offline play:
1. Navigate to `[Games] > [Download Offline]`.
2. Input the download code and give the game a recognizable name. It will download as a `.sb3` file.

To load an offline game:
1. Go to `[Settings] > [Load Offline Game]`.
2. Drag and drop the `.sb3` file into the window, and the game will load.

## Local Storage

Scratchbox uses local storage to save your data between sessions. If you encounter any issues, you can clear your local storage in two ways:

### Non-Essential Local Storage Clear:
- This option clears all local storage except your username and theme. It resets settings such as Scratchbox FPS, fallback game resolution, and fallback game FPS.

### Factory Reset:
- For a complete reset, hold down `Shift + X + F` to perform a factory refresh. Scratchbox will restart and all local storage will be cleared.

## Shortcuts

Here are some useful shortcuts to streamline your Scratchbox experience:

- **Restart Scratchbox**: `Shift + X + R`
- **Toggle FPS**: `Shift + F`

## Themes

Scratchbox offers multiple themes for customization. To change your theme:
1. Go to `[Settings] > [Theme]`.
2. Select your desired theme from the options.

If you want to apply a theme using a local storage key:
1. Navigate to `[Settings] > [Advanced Settings] > [Set Local Storage Key Value]`.
2. Enter "theme" as the key and the theme name as the value.

## Advanced Settings

In the `[Settings] > [Advanced Settings]` menu, you can modify several key performance settings:

- **Scratchbox FPS**: Changes the FPS for Scratchbox's UI.
- **Fallback Game FPS**: Sets the FPS for games that don't have pre-set values. Adjust this if a game has issues at the default 60 FPS.
- **Resolution**: Change the resolution for games with varying native resolutions.

You can also create, edit, or delete local storage keys, though this is recommended only for advanced users. If things go wrong, a factory refresh will restore default settings.

## Web Browser

Scratchbox includes a web browser for your convenience. To use it:
1. Click on the browser icon.
2. Press `Space + L` to enter a URL.
3. To exit back to the home screen, press `Space + X`.

## Help/Info

Scratchbox has a built-in help/info app. Simply click on it to revisit this guide whenever you need help.

## Chatroom

Scratchbox includes a public chat room powered by Chattable. To set your username to match your Scratchbox username:
1. Click the cog icon in the chat room's top right corner.
2. Enter your username.

To keep the username permanently, you must register a Chattable account.
